      <h1>A Transforming History</h1>
      <div class="rebel">
        <h2>The Rebellion</h2>
        <p>
          In the beginning of the era of Transformers the
          <ins>Quintessons</ins> ruled over the Transformers, they were
          slaves<br />
          who did the work of the Quintessons. After eons of servitude the
          transformers decided<br />
          it was time to rebel against their oppressors and thus the
          <strong>Autobots</strong> were born. The leader<br />
          of the Autobots was given a relic of the planet, from the core itself,
          called <strong>The Matrix of Leadership</strong>,<br />
          which held a great power within it. When the leader died the Matrix
          was passed down<br />
          to someone who was worthy. As the war continued, the autoboots began
          to lose against the Quintessons,<br />
          until they discovered that they could transform (go from their robot
          mode to a vehicle mode that they had since they<br />
          had been created) and the war started to shift in the Autobots favor
          once more. Eventually as the war raged on<br />
          the Autobots won and the Quintessons fled, thus the Transformes
          entered into a <i>Golden Age</i>.

        <h2>The Golden Age</h2>
        <p>
          The Golden Age of the Transformers is when their technological prowess
          was at their highest,<br />
          they traveled across the stars searching different planets using a
          device called a <em>Space Bridge</em>.<br />
          The Space Bridge opened up a wormhole to another planet, it basically
          turned a thousand-mile journey<br />
          into a one mile journey. As time passed new transformers began to be
          built, they were stronger<br />
          than their predecessors and they could fly, and thus they began to
          crave power. The leader<br />
          of these new transformers was Megatron, and they called themselves the
          <b>Decepticons</b>, as they gained more<br />
          power a group to repel them appeared called the Autobots, and this was
          the start of the transformer civil war.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="war">
        <h2>Civil War</h2>
        <p>
          The primary reason for the civil war was to gain control over
          Cybertron, Megatron wanted to rule<br />
          the planet and the Autobots wanted freedom for all sentient life. As
          the war raged<br />
          on for many millennia Megatron killed many primes until the burden was
          finally placed on the shoulders<br />
          of Optimus Prime. Megatron was a gladiator who fought in the Pits of
          Kaon (a renowned gladiatorial arena)<br />
          he was an expert fighter who had speed, power, and experience in
          combat while originally Optimus Prime<br />
          (or Orion Pax before he was remodeled) was a librarian in the Hall of
          Records (the most<br />
          important library on the planet, it holds all the transformers
          history). After several millennia of fighting<br />
          the energy that fueled them, Energon, began to run out, and the war
          started to shift to fighting to<br />
          preserve their current supplies of Energon and capturing and the few
          remaining unclaimed stashes left.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="escape">
        <h2>Corruption and Escape</h2>
        <p>
          Megatron in his lust for power began to search for Dark Energon, a
          corruptive substance that<br />
          destroyed all who came in contact with it, once he found it, he
          planned on injecting<br />
          it into the core of Cybertron (the core creates Energon that the
          Tranformers used) in order<br />
          to control the planet. After the core was liberated from the control
          of the Decepticons by<br />
          Optimus and his elite fighters, the core had to power down for
          millions of years to<br />
          rid itself of the Dark Energon, and because of this the planet could
          no longer<br />
          sustain life. This is when all the transformers, except the leaders
          and a small portion<br />
          of their armies, began to flee the planet in order to search for a new
          home amongst<br />
          the stars. After a while the leaders, and what was left of their
          armies,<br />
          left Cybertron and after a taxing fight they landed on Earth 65
          million years ago.

          The remaining armies (which were basically the 20 or so elites on each
          side who survived)<br />
          were in stasis until the 21<sup>st</sup> century where a small tremor
          caused a Decepticon to wake up<br />
          and heal the other Decepticons. In a failed attempt kill the autoboots
          the blasted the cave which<br />
          caused one of the autoboots to fall into the reaping area of the ship
          and thus<br />
          the Autobots began to be repaired. Once the Decepticons woke up they
          began to steal energy<br />
          in order to make Energon cubes so they could go back to Cybertron and
          reclaim<br />
          their home world; however, the Autobots stopped them every time. To
          this day the Autobots and<br />
          Decepticons continue fight each other until the other is finally wiped
          out.
